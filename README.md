# Piedmont Park Tour App

## About 
An app created through the #greenspacehack to allow visitors to Piedmont Park to interact with the features of the park and learn about the history.  

Path will allow users to enter the park at any point and see what are the available points of interest in the map.  In the future users will be able to traverse the park and as they approach points of interest additional information about that point will appear.

Explore offers a video simulating what a user would experience with Augmented Reality (AR).

Activities provides information on activities available at the park

Events provides information on events being held at the park.

Food displays some nearby restaurants with links to their websites.
